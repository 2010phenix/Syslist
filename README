Syslist is a web-based Mac and PC computer inventory and helpdesk solution that tracks your computers, network hardware, and sofware. Audit your IT assets quickly with Syslist!

Syslist operated as a for-profit company from 2002 until 2012.  As part of shutting the business down, we decided to open source all Syslist code.  This includes:
/web/ a PHP + MySQL website for displaying system information
/windows_agent/ a Windows background process that collects system information and reports it to the server
/mac_agent/ a Mac OSX background process that collects system information and reports it to the server
/binaries/ containing:
- agents.zip executables for the Windows and Mac agents
- syslist410.zip the encoded, sale version of /web/

This code is being provided with NO SUPPORT WHATSOEVER.  Do whatever you like with it -- subject the MIT license found in license.txt -- but don't expect help or support.
