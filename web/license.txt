This software program, known as "Syslist" and comprised of the Syslist Server, Companion Agent, and Remote Installer (hereafter referred to as "Program"), is the copyrighted work of Literal Technology, a software development and consulting business based in Chapel Hill, NC USA. The Program is governed by the terms of the End User License Agreement which is provided below ("License Agreement").

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

1. Limited Use License. Literal Technology hereby grants, and by installing the Program You thereby accept, a limited, non-exclusive license and right to install one (1) copy of the Syslist Server (which is the web server / database portion of the Program). This license permits unlimited web connections to that Syslist Server installation, as long as those connections originate from PCs belonging to the organization, and/or from employees or contractors working for the organization. The first license purchased will entitle You to inventory up to 100 systems. ('Systems' are a concept in the Program. They are typically PCs, servers, etc, though you may choose to designate other network hardware as a system, such as switches or firewalls.) Additional licenses entitle you to inventory 100 additional systems with each license.

2. Ownership. All title, ownership, and intellectual property rights in and to the Program and any and all copies thereof are owned by Literal Technology. The Program is protected by the copyright laws of the United States, international copyright treaties and conventions, and other laws. All rights are reserved.

3. Responsibilities of End User.

   A. You may not in any way modify the source code or database structure of The Program without permanently waiving your rights under the Syslist Support Agreement.

   B. The Program is licensed to You as a single product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than one computer.

   C. You are entitled to use the Program for your own use, but You are not entitled to sell or grant a security interest in or transfer reproductions of the Program to other parties in any way, nor to rent, lease, or license the Program to others without the prior written consent of Literal Technology.

The entire risk arising out of use or performance of the Program remains with the You.

ANY WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT THAT MAY BE PROVIDED IN SECTION 2-312(3) OF THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE AND/OR IN ANY OTHER COMPARABLE STATE STATUTE IS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. FURTHER, LITERAL TECHNOLOGY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR THE LOSS OR DAMAGE TO DATA STORED IN THE PROGRAM DATABASE, OR ELSEWHERE. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, or allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitations may not apply.
