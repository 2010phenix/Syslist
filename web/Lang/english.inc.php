      <b>system</b>.\n
      <p>A <b>system</b> is, primarily, a PC, workstation, or server (though it can be anything that typically
      has an IP address and/or hostname. For example, a network printer).\n
      <p>To add systems to your inventory, you would either use the Syslist Companion Agent (which automatically
      adds PC and Mac inventory to your database, including software and hardware) or manually create a
      \"system type.\"\n If you manually create a system type, you may wish to give it \"default peripherals\"
      (ie hard drive, mouse, etc) and \"default software\". When you manually add a new system to your inventory
      database, the defaults associated with the system type will automatically be created and associated with the
      new system.\n
      <p>Systems can be designated \"spare\" (ie, just sitting around, waiting to be used), \"independent\"
      (ie, shared by a department, or simply not belonging to anyone in specific), or they can be assigned to a
      user.\n
      <p>A <b>user</b> is a person, such as yourself. Any user can be assigned a system. In this way, you can keep
      track of who is using what in your organization.\n
      <p>Some users are \"special.\" At the lowest level, they may view your inventory. At the highest level,
      they may create other users, add data to your inventory, etc.
      <p><b>Peripherals</b> and <b>Software</b> can both be assigned to a system, or can be lying around as
      \"spare\" objects. As with systems, you will need to define \"periperhal types\" and/or \"software types\"
      before you can manually assign peripherals and software to a system. (However, many peripheral and software
      types  will be automatically created for you by the Syslist Companion Agent.)\n
      <p>Peripherals can be just about any type of hardware you can think of: a hard drive, a monitor, a keyboard...
      whatever.\n
      <p>Software is just that. You can have two types: \"Operating System\" and \"Other\". Examples of an
      Operating System: Windows 98, Windows 2000, Red Hat Linux, Etc. Systems can have more than one Operating
      System, if you wish. Non-operating systems are things like Antivirus Software, Microsoft Office, etc.\n
      <p>Syslist's software system can help you track the number of legal licenses you have for each software
      type, if you wish. It will warn you when you have added too many instances of a software type, depending
      upon what kind of license you choose.\n
